# üåæ Crop Yield Prediction using LSTM and Time-Series Decomposition

This repository presents a **data-driven analysis of agricultural productivity** across five villages in Karnataka‚Äî**Dhawaleshwar, Kulali, Mahalingpur, Munyal, and Teradal**‚Äîover a six-year period (2007‚Äì2012).  
The study leverages **climate data and vegetation indices** to model and forecast crop yields, providing insights into how environmental variability affects agricultural output.

## üìå Project Overview
Agricultural productivity is shaped by complex interactions between **rainfall, temperature, and vegetation dynamics**.  
This project integrates **statistical time-series analysis** with **deep learning (LSTM)** to:
- Analyze climatic variables and vegetation indices.
- Perform seasonal decomposition to identify trend, seasonality, and residual effects.
- Forecast crop yields using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE):**
  - Precipitation (mm)
  - Temperature (¬∞C)
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI)
  - Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)
- **Crop Yield Data:** Village-level datasets (2007‚Äì2012)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing values handled and temporal alignment performed.
   - Features normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Data reshaped into supervised format:  
     \[
     X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times T \times F}, \quad y \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times 1}
     \]
     where:
     - \(N\) = number of samples  
     - \(T\) = lookback period  
     - \(F\) = number of features  

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Seasonal decomposition applied to precipitation, temperature, LAI, FAPAR, and yield.

3. **Model Architecture**
   - Two stacked **LSTM layers** (50 units each).
   - One **Dense layer** (1 neuron) for yield prediction.
   - Total trainable parameters: **31,451**.

4. **Training & Optimization**
   - Optimizer: **Adam**  
   - Loss: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
   - Training: 10 epochs, batch size = 32  
   - Validation split = 20%

## üìä Performance Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**  
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  
  \[
  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}
  \]

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**  
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \hat{y}_i|
  \]

- **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$):**  
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}
  \]

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):**  
  \[
  \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right|
  \]
